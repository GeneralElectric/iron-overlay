Iron-Overlay
-----------------------------------------------

## Overview

Based heavily on Polymer core-overlay#0.8-preview-wip branch. In fact, this component should be deleted when the official iron-overlay is ready.
We should not be maintaining this abstract functionality.

## Why isn't this a fork?

The polymer team is going to move core-overlay to PolymerElements/iron-overlay when it's ready...also, this stuff is not meant to be directly contributed back.

## Getting Started

From the component's directory...

```
$ npm install
$ bower install
```

### API and examples

From the component's directory

```
$ grunt depserve
```

Starts a local server. Navigate to the root of that server (e.g. http://localhost:8080/) in a browser to open the API documentation page, with link to the "Demo" / working examples.

### Options

Does this component have runtime configuration options?  If so, they should be able to be passed as attributes on the element with examples shown below.
